a Tetris-like game, with GUI implemented with X11 library.

<h1>Pre-installation</h1>
1. Make sure you are using a linux based operating system (e.g. Ubuntu, MAC OS X, or linux virtual machine).
2. Make sure you have already installed X11 library. (i.e., <pre style="display:inline"><code>/usr/X11R6/lib</code></pre> exists)
3. Make sure you have c++ compiler ready. (e.g., g++)

<h1>Installation</h1>
1. Pull the source code.
2. Open a terminal, and cd into the top-level source code directory.
3. Type <code>make</code>
4. There is no 4.

<h1>Playing</h1>
1. cd into the compiled directory.
2. Type ./quadris
3. Start Quadris-ing!
4. Type <code>help</code> in the terminal for more information.

<h1>What's More...</h1>
1. You can reference the UML modeling chart in UML directory.
2. You can type the least-unambiguous-short-hand command to control a block. 
    (e.g., if you want to move the block to the left, just type <code>lef</code>.)
3. If you want to repeat a command <code>N</code> times, just type <code>N\<command\></code>.
    (for example, typing <code>4lef</code> means move the block 4 distance units to the left.)
4. Stay tuned for a complete manual.
